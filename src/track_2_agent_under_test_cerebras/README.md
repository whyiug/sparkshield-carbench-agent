# Track 2 Cerebras Agent Under Test

This package is the direct Track 2 Cerebras Fast-Reasoning starter agent for
CAR-bench A2A evaluation. It calls Cerebras-hosted `gpt-oss` models directly
through the Cerebras Python SDK and returns the same benchmark-visible A2A text
responses or tool calls as the Track 1 template.

The default executor model is `gpt-oss-120b` with
`TRACK2_EXECUTOR_REASONING_EFFORT=medium`. Participants should use a
Cerebras-hosted `gpt-oss` executor model, while replacing prompting,
validation, or harnessing strategy as long as the external A2A contract stays
unchanged.

## What This Agent Demonstrates

- Parses evaluator messages into policy/user text, tool definitions, and tool
  results.
- Maintains conversation history per `context_id`.
- Calls the Cerebras SDK `chat.completions.with_raw_response.create(...)`.
- Uses Cerebras structured JSON schema output for a strict next-action object.
- Logs successful-response `x-ratelimit-*` headers for visibility.
- Writes JSON rate-limit reports for Cerebras 429s, including provider headers
  and error body.

## Configuration

Set the evaluator key and Cerebras key in `.env`:

```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=...
CEREBRAS_API_KEY=...
TRACK2_EXECUTOR_MODEL=gpt-oss-120b
TRACK2_EXECUTOR_REASONING_EFFORT=medium
```

Important environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CEREBRAS_API_KEY` | required | Cerebras API key used by the SDK. |
| `TRACK2_EXECUTOR_MODEL` | `gpt-oss-120b` | Cerebras-hosted `gpt-oss` executor model. Old `cerebras/...` prefixes are accepted and stripped for compatibility. |
| `TRACK2_EXECUTOR_REASONING_EFFORT` | `medium` | Cerebras `gpt-oss` reasoning effort for executor calls. Supported values are `low`, `medium`, and `high`. |
| `TRACK2_CEREBRAS_SERVICE_TIER` | unset | Optional Cerebras service tier, for example `default`, `priority`, `auto`, or `flex`. |
| `TRACK2_MAX_COMPLETION_TOKENS` | `1024` | Completion-token cap for executor calls. |
| `TRACK2_TEMPERATURE` | unset | Optional executor temperature. Leave unset to use the provider default. |
| `TRACK2_CEREBRAS_QUEUE_BACKOFF_SECONDS` | `60` | Nominal first local pause after a provider `queue_exceeded` 429. |
| `TRACK2_CEREBRAS_QUEUE_BACKOFF_INITIAL_JITTER_RATIO` | `0.1` | First queue retry jitter ratio; default gives roughly 54-66 seconds. |
| `TRACK2_CEREBRAS_QUEUE_BACKOFF_SECOND_MIN_SECONDS` | `90` | Minimum second queue retry wait. |
| `TRACK2_CEREBRAS_QUEUE_BACKOFF_SECOND_MAX_SECONDS` | `120` | Maximum second queue retry wait. |
| `TRACK2_CEREBRAS_QUEUE_BACKOFF_CAP_MIN_SECONDS` | `180` | Minimum third-and-later queue retry wait. |
| `TRACK2_CEREBRAS_QUEUE_BACKOFF_CAP_MAX_SECONDS` | `300` | Maximum third-and-later queue retry wait. |
| `TRACK2_CEREBRAS_RATE_LIMIT_RETRY_BUFFER_SECONDS` | `1` | Safety buffer added to provider reset or retry headers before retrying a 429. |
| `CAR_BENCH_CEREBRAS_RATE_LIMIT_REPORT_DIR` | `/tmp/car-bench-rate-limit-reports` | Directory for Cerebras rate-limit JSON reports. Falls back to `CAR_BENCH_RATE_LIMIT_REPORT_DIR` when set. |
| `TRACK2_LLM_MALFORMED_RETRIES` | `1` | Retry budget for malformed next-action JSON. |

## Rate Limits And Development Windows

During normal development, participants are expected to use the Cerebras public
tier, where rate limits can be strict. Use smaller smoke scenarios first, keep
`TRACK2_MAX_COMPLETION_TOKENS` as low as the task allows, and schedule larger
public-tier runs externally instead of launching many jobs at once.

The reference client does not proactively throttle based on local request/token
limits or previous successful responses. It sends the request and only waits
reactively after a provider-visible Cerebras 429.
The reference client records successful provider-call timings and keeps failed
429 attempts in logs/reports.

When a Cerebras 429 is observed, the client writes a JSON report by default to
`/tmp/car-bench-rate-limit-reports`. The report includes session start time,
wall time until the limit, wall time since the previous limit/retry marker,
successful-call token usage, estimated attempted request tokens, the current
failed call shape, and the raw provider payload. A provider
`queue_exceeded` error respects `retry-after` if Cerebras sends one; otherwise
it applies jittered local backoff: roughly 60 seconds on the first queue retry,
90-120 seconds on the second, and 180-300 seconds on later queue retries. A
quota error with `x-ratelimit-reset-tokens-minute` applies that reset hint plus
the configured buffer before retrying. If Cerebras omits that token-reset
header, the client logs the missing header and falls back to
`x-ratelimit-reset-requests-day` or `retry-after` when present.
Final time-budget and quota-wait accounting details will be announced before
the official evaluation.

Terminal logs show the attempted request estimate, previous successful
rate-limit headers when available, and on 429 the wait duration, resume time,
wait reason, source header, reset-header values, and any expected reset header
that Cerebras did not provide.

Organizers will provide a few test windows with elevated rate limits and
priority tier access so participants can test harness behavior at higher speed
and with less throttling. Participants may also self-host the open-source models
used by the Cerebras `gpt-oss` executor during development, then validate
speed-sensitive behavior during those windows.

Codex Pro plans are still provided for selected Track 2 teams to accelerate
harness engineering and development. They are not the submitted-agent runtime
for this template. Plans are allocated by June 15.
