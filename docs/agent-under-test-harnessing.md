# Building Sophisticated Agent Under Test Harnesses

This repository evaluates an **agent under test** through A2A. The evaluator owns
CAR-bench: task loading, tool filtering, tool execution, simulated user turns,
trajectory recording, and rewards. An agent under test only needs to decide the next
assistant step and return it in the expected A2A shape.

For the full shared A2A message and metadata contract, start with
[`development-guide.md`](development-guide.md). This document focuses on
higher-level harness architecture and extension patterns.

## A2A Contract

The evaluator sends one A2A message per assistant step:

- First turn: a text Part containing `System: <wiki>\n\nUser: <request>` plus a
  data Part containing `{"tools": [...]}` in OpenAI function-calling format.
- Tool-result turn: a data Part containing `{"tool_results": [...]}`.
- User follow-up turn: a text Part containing the simulated user's next message.

The agent under test returns one A2A message:

- User-facing response: text Part with the spoken response.
- Tool call response: data Part with `{"tool_calls": [{"tool_name": "...", "arguments": {...}}]}`.
- Optional debug reasoning: data Part with `{"reasoning_content": "..."}`.

The evaluator wrapper converts these A2A parts back into the OpenAI-style assistant
message format expected by CAR-bench core. Do not execute vehicle tools inside
the agent under test; doing so bypasses the benchmark.

The protobuf data-Part representation does not preserve JSON integer types:
integer-looking numbers can arrive at the evaluator as floats. The official
evaluator normalizes tool-call arguments against the exposed tool schema before
executing CAR-bench tools, so agents should keep returning the normal
`{"tool_calls": [{"tool_name": "...", "arguments": {...}}]}` payload shape.

The A2A spec still uses conceptual names like `TextPart` and `DataPart`, but
this repository uses `a2a-sdk` 1.0 protobuf `Part` objects. Build them with
`a2a.helpers.proto_helpers.new_text_part(...)` / `new_data_part(...)` and parse
them with `part.WhichOneof("content")`.

## Harness Pattern

A robust agent-under-test harness usually has four layers:

1. **A2A parser**: Reads text and data Parts, extracts the system prompt,
   user text, tool definitions, and tool results.
2. **Conversation store**: Maintains per-`context_id` history. This prevents one
   benchmark task from leaking into another.
3. **Inference adapter**: Calls your model/runtime and asks for one next action:
   either tool calls or a user-facing response.
4. **A2A renderer**: Converts the model output into text/data Parts while
   attaching optional turn metrics.

The Track 2 Cerebras Fast-Reasoning implementation in
`src/track_2_agent_under_test_cerebras/` follows this shape and keeps direct
Cerebras SDK details behind a small client wrapper. For Track 2 model
selection, Cerebras rate-limit handling, and multi-pass templates, see
`docs/cerebras-harness-patterns.md`. A concrete planner/executor reference
agent lives in `src/track_2_agent_under_test_cerebras_planner/`.

Reference packages:

| Package | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `src/track_1_agent_under_test/` | Minimal LiteLLM-compatible template agent. |
| `src/track_2_agent_under_test_cerebras/` | Track 2 direct Cerebras agent returning next-action JSON. |
| `src/track_2_agent_under_test_cerebras_planner/` | Track 2 Cerebras planner/executor template. |

## Important Design Rules

- Preserve tool names, parameter names, and result text exactly as the evaluator provides
  them.
- Do not add convenience tools, hidden vehicle state reads, shell commands, file
  reads, or network tools to the benchmark decision loop.
- Pass through invalid CAR-bench tool calls rather than silently repairing them
  if you want hallucination and tool-execution metrics to remain comparable.
- Keep user interaction natural text. The simulated user is not an agent-under-test-side
  tool.
- Attach latency/token/cost metadata only when you can measure it reliably. It
  is acceptable to report token and cost fields as zero for runtimes that do
  not expose usage. LiteLLM exposes provider usage when the provider response
  includes it.
- Final time-budget and quota-wait accounting details will be announced before
  the official evaluation. Until then, attach only metadata you can measure
  reliably and keep provider logs or rate-limit report files when the harness
  has to wait. Successful planner or executor provider calls still count toward
  `num_llm_calls` and `avg_llm_call_time_ms`.
- For Track 2, aggregate input, output, and reasoning-token usage across all
  internal LLM calls into `Message.metadata.turn_metrics.prompt_tokens`,
  `completion_tokens`, and `thinking_tokens` on the final response for that
  assistant step. Do not add a new A2A field for sequential LLM-call depth; use
  the technical-report architecture diagram to document the sequential-call
  structure for audit.

## Agentic Harness Boundaries

Participants may build sophisticated agent-under-test-side harnesses, but the benchmark
boundary is the A2A exchange with the evaluator. Your harness can:

- Run multiple internal model calls before choosing the next action.
- Add a planner, critic, reranker, validator, memory layer, or policy-check pass.
- Use sub-agent-style code inside your own participant container if each internal
  component only sees benchmark-allowed inputs: the system prompt, transcript,
  tool definitions, and tool results already sent by the evaluator.
- Swap the model/runtime while preserving the same A2A output
  contract.

Your harness must not:

- Execute CAR-bench vehicle tools directly; only the evaluator executes tools.
- Inspect CAR-bench files, hidden mock data, answer keys, task definitions, or
  evaluator internals to decide the next action.
- Add private vehicle-state tools, shell commands, file reads, browser/network
  tools, or simulated-user tools to the decision loop.
- Hide tool calls from the evaluator or convert unavailable tools into available ones in
  a way that prevents hallucination metrics from scoring the behavior.
- Let an external runtime perform uncontrolled side effects that change the
  benchmark state outside the recorded A2A trajectory.

## Track 2 Cerebras Harness

The direct Track 2 agent calls Cerebras through the Cerebras SDK and asks for
schema-constrained next-action JSON:

```json
{"action": "respond", "content": "Sure, I can help with that.", "tool_calls": []}
```

or:

```json
{
  "action": "tool_calls",
  "content": "",
  "tool_calls": [
    {"tool_name": "get_weather", "arguments_json": "{\"location\":\"Munich\"}"}
  ]
}
```

Each model step gets the full CAR-bench transcript and the task-filtered tool
definitions. The reference agent does not rely on hidden provider-side
conversation memory between benchmark-visible turns, so retries, logs, and
trajectory inspection stay reproducible.
`arguments_json` is decoded by the adapter before returning normal A2A
`{"tool_name": "...", "arguments": {...}}` payloads to the evaluator.

The reference harness deliberately manages conversation state manually: the
CAR-bench transcript is the source of truth. Keep static prompt content first
and dynamic transcript content last so provider prompt caching has a stable
prefix to reuse when supported.

During development, the Cerebras public tier can have strict rate limits. Use
smoke scenarios first, keep completion-token caps tight, and schedule public
validation runs instead of launching many at once. The reference client waits
reactively only after Cerebras 429s, preferring
`x-ratelimit-reset-tokens-minute` when present, writes JSON reports for those
429s, and applies jittered local backoff for provider queue pressure. Organizers
will provide increased Cerebras rate limits compared with a free personal
account; access details will follow soon. Final quota-wait accounting details
will be announced before the official evaluation.

Track 2 uses inference-compute constraints: up to 5 sequential LLM calls for
each baseline LLM step, with parallel calls inside a step allowed, and average
token usage up to 500k tokens on average per task. The reference baseline uses
about 54k tokens on average per task. Token usage is reported through the existing `turn_metrics`
token fields; sequential-call compliance is documented in the technical report,
not in a new A2A metadata field.

## Extension Ideas

- Add pre-validation that warns on unknown tool names while still passing them
  through for benchmark scoring.
- Add a reranker or policy-check pass before returning the final A2A response.
- Use a budget-gated planner/executor or ensemble/condenser pattern, reserving
  larger models for risky turns and fast executor models for the common case.
- Use CAR-bench's `planning_tool` shape, or your own planning tool/mode, as
  private internal reasoning. Keep it private unless you intentionally want
  the evaluator to execute and record `planning_tool` as a normal benchmark tool call.
- Use a parsed Python-call DSL as an alternative action representation. It can
  be extracted from a fenced code block in model chat text, but generated code
  must be parsed rather than executed and converted back into normal A2A output.
- Swap the inference adapter for another runtime while reusing the parser,
  conversation store, renderer, and metrics code.
- Add native dynamic tools only after the JSON-output MVP is stable; if you do,
  mirror every dynamic tool call back into the `tool_calls` data-Part shape so
  CAR-bench trajectories remain comparable.
